	"""An implementation of a quad-tree.
 
	This QuadTree started life as a version of [1] but found a life of its own
	when I realised it wasn't doing what I needed. It is intended for static
	geometry, ie, items such as the landscape that don't move.
 
	This implementation inserts items at the current level if they overlap all
	4 sub-quadrants, otherwise it inserts them recursively into the one or two
	sub-quadrants that they overlap.
 
	Items being stored in the tree must possess the following attributes:
		(Upper left coordinate system)
 
		left - the x coordinate of the left edge of the item's bounding box.
		top - the y coordinate of the top edge of the item's bounding box.
		right - the x coordinate of the right edge of the item's bounding box.
		bottom - the y coordinate of the bottom edge of the item's bounding box.
 
		where left < right and top < bottom
		
	...and they must be hashable.
