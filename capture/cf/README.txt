Keyboard shortcuts

Enter/Return
Submit tile
Your changes will be accepted as the new truth

Esc             
Skip this tile
It will be flagged for administrative review
Do this if it has severe errors
Ex: do this if grid is detected incorrectly

M
Convert all flagged areas to metal

W
Convert all flagged areas to empty

L
Convert all unknown areas to metal that have at least two adjacent metal tiles in a row 



Please try to make a decision on yellow areas rather than punting
If it arguably makes the net larger favor making the net larger
Do not do this if it would incorrectly merge nets
